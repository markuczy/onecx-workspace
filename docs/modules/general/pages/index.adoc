== Structure Overview
OneCX Workspace Software is a comprehensive solution for managing Workspaces in a user-friendly and efficient manner.
It is a solution that consists of three main components: a backend service, a user interface and a backend-for-frontend (BFF) layer.

The three components of the OneCX Workspace Software are as follows:

. Workspace User Interface (UI)
  The user interface component is based on Angular, a popular JavaScript framework for building dynamic web applications.
  It offers a user-friendly and intuitive interface for interacting with the Workspace system.
  Users can perform actions such as searching and editing of Workspaces.

. Workspace Backend for Frontend (BFF)
  The BFF layer acts as an intermediary between the frontend user interface and the backend service.
  It handles tasks such as data aggregation, transformation, and composition to provide an optimized API for the UI.
  The BFF layer is designed to enhance performance and simplify the integration of the frontend with the backend service.

. Workspace Backend Service (SVC)
  This component provides the core functionality.
  It handles tasks such as storage, retrieval and editing of Workspaces.
  The backend is built cloud native using Quarkus.

Interfaces are based on the TM-Forum standard link:https://github.com/tmforum-apis/TMF667_Document[TMF 667].
